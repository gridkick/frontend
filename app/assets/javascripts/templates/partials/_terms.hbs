<p></p>
<p>Should you disagree with some of the provisions herein, you can discontinue using the Website (although we'll be sad to see you go!), or contact us at support@gridkick.com.</p>
<h2>2. Changes to the Terms of Service and the Website</h2>
<p>GridKick is a work in progress, meaning that a lot will change in the near future. We reserve the right to update the Website and these Terms of Service from time to time, at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change in a prominent way, but since &quot;major&quot; is a very subjective concept, you can always monitor and subscribe to changes via the TOS Tracker on Docracy.com. Of course, this document is public on Docracy, and you will be able to see the changes for any new version (just click on the &quot;See all versions&quot; button on the right). <strong>Your continued use of the Website following the publishing of updated Terms of Service means that you accept and agree to the changes.</strong></p>
<h2>3. Accessing the Website, Security and Privacy</h2>
<p>We are working hard on improving GridKick, but we can't guarantee that the Website will be up and running 24/7. We also reserve the right to suspend or restrict access to some features to users. In any case, we will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of the Website is unavailable at any time or for any period, nor for any data loss (see also section 7 below).</p>
<p>To access certain features of the Website you have to register by entering your email and choosing a password as part of our security procedures. You must treat such information as confidential, not disclosing it to any third party and only using GridKick in person. There is a password reset procedure in case you forget your password, but please notify us of any breach of security. We highly recommend to choose a strong password (e.g. &quot;<a href="http://xkcd.com/936/" target="_blank">correcthorsebatterystaple</a>&quot;) and that you log out from your account at the end of every session.</p>
<p>It is a condition of your use of the Website that all the information you provide on the Website is correct, current and complete. In the future, you may be asked to provide certain registration details or other information.
